Alice\u2019s Evidence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\r\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\r\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\r\nconversations in it, \u201cand what is the use of a book,\u201d thought Alice\r\n\u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d\r\n\r\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\r\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\r\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\r\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\r\nclose by her.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\r\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh\r\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards,\r\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\r\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\r\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\r\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\r\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\r\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\r\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\r\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\r\n\r\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\r\nin the world she was to get out again.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\r\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\r\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\r\ndeep well.\r\n\r\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\r\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\r\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\r\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\r\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\r\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\r\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\r\npassed; it was labelled \u201cORANGE MARMALADE\u201d, but to her great\r\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\r\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\r\ncupboards as she fell past it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d thought Alice to herself, \u201cafter such a fall as this, I shall\r\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs!

How she longed to get\r\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\r\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\r\nthrough the doorway; \u201cand even if my head would go through,\u201d thought\r\npoor Alice, \u201cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\r\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\r\nknew how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\r\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\r\nindeed were really impossible.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\r\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\r\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\r\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was not here\r\nbefore,\u201d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\r\nlabel, with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d beautifully printed on it in large\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nIt was all very well to say \u201cDrink me,\u201d but the wise little Alice was\r\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll look first,\u201d she said,\r\n\u201cand see whether it\u2019s marked \u2018_poison_\u2019 or not\u201d; for she had read\r\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\r\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\r\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\r\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\r\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\r\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\r\nbottle marked \u201cpoison,\u201d it is almost certain to disagree with you,\r\nsooner or later.\r\n\r\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked \u201cpoison,\u201d so Alice ventured to\r\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\r\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\r\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a curious feeling!\u201d said Alice; \u201cI must be shutting up like a\r\ntelescope.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\r\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\r\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\r\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\r\nshe felt a little nervous about this; \u201cfor it might end, you know,\u201d\r\nsaid Alice to herself, \u201cin my going out altogether, like a candle.

(Alice had been to the seaside once in\r\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\r\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\r\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\r\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\r\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\r\nshe was nine feet high.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u201d said Alice, as she swam about, trying\r\nto find her way out. \u201cI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\r\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\r\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\r\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\r\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\r\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\r\nslipped in like herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cWould it be of any use, now,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cto speak to this mouse?\r\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\r\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying.\u201d So she\r\nbegan: \u201cO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\r\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!\u201d (Alice thought this must be the right\r\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\r\nshe remembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u201cA mouse\u2014of\r\na mouse\u2014to a mouse\u2014a mouse\u2014O mouse!\u201d) The Mouse looked at her rather\r\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\r\nbut it said nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cI daresay it\u2019s\r\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u201d (For, with all\r\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\r\nanything had happened.) So she began again: \u201cO\u00f9 est ma chatte?\u201d which\r\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\r\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\r\nfright. \u201cOh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\r\nhad hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings. \u201cI quite forgot you didn\u2019t like\r\ncats.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot like cats!\u201d cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u201cWould\r\n_you_ like cats if you were me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, perhaps not,\u201d said Alice in a soothing tone: \u201cdon\u2019t be angry\r\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d\r\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\r\nquiet thing,\u201d Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\r\nin the pool, \u201cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\r\npaws and washing her face\u2014and she is such a nice soft thing to\r\nnurse\u2014and she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice\u2014oh, I beg your\r\npardon!\u201d cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\r\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk\r\nabout her any more if you\u2019d rather not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe indeed!\u201d cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\r\ntail. \u201cAs if _I_ would talk on such a subject!

Don\u2019t let me hear the name\r\nagain!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t indeed!\u201d said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\r\nconversation. \u201cAre you\u2014are you fond\u2014of\u2014of dogs?\u201d The Mouse did not\r\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: \u201cThere is such a nice little dog near\r\nour house I should like to show you!

Indeed, she had quite a long argument\r\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u201cI am\r\nolder than you, and must know better;\u201d and this Alice would not allow\r\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\r\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\r\n\r\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\r\ncalled out, \u201cSit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I\u2019ll_ soon make\r\nyou dry enough!\u201d They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\r\nMouse in the middle.

There was no \u201cOne, two, three, and\r\naway,\u201d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\r\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\r\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\r\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out \u201cThe race is over!\u201d and they all\r\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, \u201cBut who has won?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\r\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\r\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\r\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\r\nsaid, \u201c_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who is to give the prizes?\u201d quite a chorus of voices asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, _she_, of course,\u201d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\r\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\r\nconfused way, \u201cPrizes! Prizes!\u201d\r\n\r\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\r\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\r\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\r\none a-piece, all round.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\u201d said the Mouse.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Dodo replied very gravely. \u201cWhat else have you got in\r\nyour pocket?\u201d he went on, turning to Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly a thimble,\u201d said Alice sadly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHand it over here,\u201d said the Dodo.\r\n\r\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\r\npresented the thimble, saying \u201cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant\r\nthimble;\u201d and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\r\ncheered.\r\n\r\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\r\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\r\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\r\nshe could.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\r\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\r\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\r\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\r\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou promised to tell me your history, you know,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand why\r\nit is you hate\u2014C and D,\u201d she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\r\nwould be offended again.\r\n\r\n\u201cMine is a long and a sad tale!\u201d said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\r\nsighing.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 25975, "end_char_idx": 29774, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37667265-f19f-47ad-8605-17eb94e0f8fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "37667265-f19f-47ad-8605-17eb94e0f8fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "681b3ce9-f589-43c7-815d-b026178ab5e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "hash": "b3b90e6e03697f74cbe8b553cf71e90ee153d5c3bdcc5912167e36d17a349b6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c372901-d9a2-4764-a2e9-6142c4031e65", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "hash": "1ed9e275d6cdf8e4fd3a7c7b9bb020d6a07ee218b4588911938aa6099c57e03d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a17e554-5b92-4604-9391-9cda2f50cdb2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b9618a9b90868afd2f04d4294ef8b98fa0e9d5e999ade106f23bc2cf03182a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u201cMine is a long and a sad tale!\u201d said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\r\nsighing.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt _is_ a long tail, certainly,\u201d said Alice, looking down with wonder\r\nat the Mouse\u2019s tail;

Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\r\na fan! Quick, now!\u201d And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\r\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\r\nmistake it had made.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe took me for his housemaid,\u201d she said to herself as she ran. \u201cHow\r\nsurprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him\r\nhis fan and gloves\u2014that is, if I can find them.\u201d As she said this, she\r\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\r\nplate with the name \u201cW. RABBIT,\u201d engraved upon it. She went in without\r\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\r\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\r\nfan and gloves.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow queer it seems,\u201d Alice said to herself, \u201cto be going messages for\r\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u201d And she\r\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u201c\u2018Miss Alice! Come\r\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!\u2019 \u2018Coming in a minute,\r\nnurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 Only I\r\ndon\u2019t think,\u201d Alice went on, \u201cthat they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house\r\nif it began ordering people about like that!\u201d\r\n\r\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\r\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\r\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\r\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\r\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\r\nthis time with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d but nevertheless she uncorked it\r\nand put it to her lips. \u201cI know _something_ interesting is sure to\r\nhappen,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so\r\nI\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large\r\nagain, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\r\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\r\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.

I almost wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit-hole\u2014and yet\u2014and\r\nyet\u2014it\u2019s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\r\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\r\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\r\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\r\nwhen I grow up, I\u2019ll write one\u2014but I\u2019m grown up now,\u201d she added in a\r\nsorrowful tone; \u201cat least there\u2019s no room to grow up any more _here_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut then,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cshall I _never_ get any older than I am\r\nnow? That\u2019ll be a comfort, one way\u2014never to be an old woman\u2014but\r\nthen\u2014always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\u2019t like _that!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you foolish Alice!\u201d she answered herself. \u201cHow can you learn\r\nlessons in here? Why, there\u2019s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\r\nfor any lesson-books!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\r\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\r\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\r\n\r\n\u201cMary Ann! Mary Ann!\u201d said the voice. \u201cFetch me my gloves this moment!\u201d\r\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\r\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\r\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\r\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\r\n\r\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\r\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice\u2019s elbow was pressed hard against it,\r\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \u201cThen I\u2019ll\r\ngo round and get in at the window.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_That_ you won\u2019t!\u201d thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\r\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\r\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\r\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\r\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\r\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\r\n\r\nNext came an angry voice\u2014the Rabbit\u2019s\u2014\u201cPat! Pat! Where are you?\u201d And\r\nthen a voice she had never heard before, \u201cSure then I\u2019m here! Digging\r\nfor apples, yer honour!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDigging for apples, indeed!\u201d said the Rabbit angrily. \u201cHere! Come and\r\nhelp me out of _this!_\u201d (Sounds of more broken glass.)\r\n\r\n\u201cNow tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u201d (He pronounced it \u201carrum.\u201d)\r\n\r\n\u201cAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\r\nwindow!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\r\nnow and then; such as, \u201cSure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at\r\nall!\u201d \u201cDo as I tell you, you coward!\u201d and at last she spread out her\r\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\r\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \u201cWhat a number\r\nof cucumber-frames there must be!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI wonder what\r\nthey\u2019ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\r\n_could!_ I\u2019m sure _I_ don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\r\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\r\ntalking together: she made out the words: \u201cWhere\u2019s the other\r\nladder?\u2014Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other\u2014Bill!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 37036, "end_char_idx": 40715, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72768f43-ede7-4259-ad36-5068a92aeca9": {"__data__": {"id_": "72768f43-ede7-4259-ad36-5068a92aeca9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "681b3ce9-f589-43c7-815d-b026178ab5e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "hash": "b3b90e6e03697f74cbe8b553cf71e90ee153d5c3bdcc5912167e36d17a349b6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "22f94eb2-b5e8-4b0c-915e-4c61a6782d27", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "hash": "809ceab638caddfb87eb66ecab689f1f90d88364f222e622f7bdde9b79b92559", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "511e4a7e-ff74-4598-a765-82edec8c6dff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "02cab423df7ffe3f177fd2e0bf6387f6a39a93a990f2972da7e22f0e3ef34f19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "fetch it here, lad!\u2014Here, put \u2019em up at this corner\u2014No, tie \u2019em\r\ntogether first\u2014they don\u2019t reach half high enough yet\u2014Oh! they\u2019ll do\r\nwell enough; don\u2019t be particular\u2014Here, Bill! catch hold of this\r\nrope\u2014Will the roof bear?\u2014Mind that loose slate\u2014Oh, it\u2019s coming down!\r\nHeads below!\u201d (a loud crash)\u2014\u201cNow, who did that?\u2014It was Bill, I\r\nfancy\u2014Who\u2019s to go down the chimney?\u2014Nay, _I_ shan\u2019t! _You_ do\r\nit!\u2014_That_ I won\u2019t, then!\u2014Bill\u2019s to go down\u2014Here, Bill! the master says\r\nyou\u2019re to go down the chimney!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!

If they had any sense, they\u2019d take the\r\nroof off.\u201d After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\r\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, \u201cA barrowful will do, to begin with.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA barrowful of _what?_\u201d thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\r\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\r\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. \u201cI\u2019ll put a stop to\r\nthis,\u201d she said to herself, and shouted out, \u201cYou\u2019d better not do that\r\nagain!\u201d which produced another dead silence.\r\n\r\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\r\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\r\nhead. \u201cIf I eat one of these cakes,\u201d she thought, \u201cit\u2019s sure to make\r\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can\u2019t possibly make me larger, it\r\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\r\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\r\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\r\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\r\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\r\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\r\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\r\nsafe in a thick wood.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Alice to herself, as she\r\nwandered about in the wood, \u201cis to grow to my right size again; and the\r\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 40717, "end_char_idx": 44202, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "511e4a7e-ff74-4598-a765-82edec8c6dff": {"__data__": {"id_": "511e4a7e-ff74-4598-a765-82edec8c6dff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "681b3ce9-f589-43c7-815d-b026178ab5e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "hash": "b3b90e6e03697f74cbe8b553cf71e90ee153d5c3bdcc5912167e36d17a349b6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "72768f43-ede7-4259-ad36-5068a92aeca9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "hash": "d9e4c0660e57e30521b6afaf7772d231893a649ad51e12c0f2f01bcae929c604", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e328d03c-bc14-4601-8f83-4d9344c09bab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b55842518447b169cf0d9c3c64385e4f68335d642ee738f797b85d24dbe7facb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I think that\r\nwill be the best plan.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\r\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\r\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\r\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\r\ngreat hurry.\r\n\r\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\r\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u201cPoor little\r\nthing!\u201d said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\r\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\r\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\r\nspite of all her coaxing.\r\n\r\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\r\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\r\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\r\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\r\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\r\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\r\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\r\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\r\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\r\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\r\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\r\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\r\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\r\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\r\nand till the puppy\u2019s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u201d said Alice, as she leant\r\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\r\nleaves: \u201cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if\u2014if I\u2019d\r\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\u2019d nearly forgotten that\r\nI\u2019ve got to grow up again! Let me see\u2014how _is_ it to be managed? I\r\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\r\nquestion is, what?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\r\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\r\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\r\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\r\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\r\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\r\nwas on the top of it.\r\n\r\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\r\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\r\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\r\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\r\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\r\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are _you?_\u201d said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\r\nrather shyly, \u201cI\u2014I hardly know, sir, just at present\u2014at least I know\r\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\r\nchanged several times since then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d said the Caterpillar sternly. \u201cExplain\r\nyourself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain _myself_, I\u2019m afraid, sir,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbecause I\u2019m\r\nnot myself, you see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t put it more clearly,\u201d Alice replied very politely,\r\n\u201cfor I can\u2019t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\r\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said the Caterpillar.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 44203, "end_char_idx": 48218, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e328d03c-bc14-4601-8f83-4d9344c09bab": {"__data__": {"id_": "e328d03c-bc14-4601-8f83-4d9344c09bab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "681b3ce9-f589-43c7-815d-b026178ab5e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "hash": "b3b90e6e03697f74cbe8b553cf71e90ee153d5c3bdcc5912167e36d17a349b6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "511e4a7e-ff74-4598-a765-82edec8c6dff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "hash": "b8e34cb427acb62b7220004a81667606f886db8fa83e9864b353d4def684dc50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b68b31d1-dbe7-4c24-ac97-bcef546c2a5d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "70eee2e5aae14a8561e9a7ad145d48947fa44879c76d25ca9731cafa6e9d6e0c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u201cWell, perhaps you haven\u2019t found it so yet,\u201d said Alice; \u201cbut when you\r\nhave to turn into a chrysalis\u2014you will some day, you know\u2014and then\r\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you\u2019ll feel it a little\r\nqueer, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,\u201d said Alice; \u201call I know\r\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \u201cWho are _you?_\u201d\r\n\r\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\r\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such _very_\r\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \u201cI\r\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\r\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\r\nstate of mind, she turned away.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome back!\u201d the Caterpillar called after her. \u201cI\u2019ve something\r\nimportant to say!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep your temper,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\r\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.

In a\r\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\r\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself.

However, at\r\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\r\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now which is which?\u201d she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\r\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\r\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\r\n\r\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\r\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\r\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\r\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\r\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\r\nlefthand bit.\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, my head\u2019s free at last!\u201d said Alice in a tone of delight, which\r\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\r\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\r\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\r\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat _can_ all that green stuff be?\u201d said Alice. \u201cAnd where _have_ my\r\nshoulders got to?

Alice crouched down among the trees as well\r\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\r\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\r\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\r\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\r\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\r\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\r\n\r\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\r\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\r\nand began talking to herself, as usual. \u201cCome, there\u2019s half my plan\r\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\u2019m never sure what I\u2019m\r\ngoing to be, from one minute to another!

It was opened by\r\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\r\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\r\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\r\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\r\n\r\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\r\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\r\nsaying, in a solemn tone, \u201cFor the Duchess. An invitation from the\r\nQueen to play croquet.\u201d The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\r\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, \u201cFrom the Queen.\r\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\r\n\r\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\r\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\r\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\r\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\r\n\r\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sort of use in knocking,\u201d said the Footman, \u201cand that for\r\ntwo reasons.

For instance,\r\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\r\nknow.\u201d He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\r\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \u201cBut perhaps he can\u2019t help it,\u201d\r\nshe said to herself; \u201chis eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\r\nhead.

This time\r\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\r\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\r\ntrot away quietly into the wood. \u201cIf it had grown up,\u201d she said to\r\nherself, \u201cit would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\r\nrather a handsome pig, I think.\u201d And she began thinking over other\r\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\r\nto herself, \u201cif one only knew the right way to change them\u2014\u201d when she\r\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\r\na tree a few yards off.\r\n\r\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\r\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\r\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\r\n\r\n\u201cCheshire Puss,\u201d she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\r\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\r\nwider. \u201cCome, it\u2019s pleased so far,\u201d thought Alice, and she went on.\r\n\u201cWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u201d said the Cat.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t much care where\u2014\u201d said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u201d said the Cat.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014so long as I get _somewhere_,\u201d Alice added as an explanation.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u201d said the Cat, \u201cif you only walk long\r\nenough.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\r\nquestion. \u201cWhat sort of people live about here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn _that_ direction,\u201d the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u201clives\r\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,\u201d waving the other paw, \u201clives a\r\nMarch Hare.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 66991, "end_char_idx": 70827, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd324c60-b219-4373-ab52-828c0ca874c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd324c60-b219-4373-ab52-828c0ca874c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "681b3ce9-f589-43c7-815d-b026178ab5e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "hash": "b3b90e6e03697f74cbe8b553cf71e90ee153d5c3bdcc5912167e36d17a349b6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b88c6030-6646-4764-8032-c11ca87f09a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "hash": "34c270af5fd62e15c532492d60d4a9200f6a101304fec4a5ce2b7830db73136b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3d2f983-04c4-48b8-8635-1eea021a13c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "98f073045ae012375a2ef7d15c18b53a804c67a49fefcdbd2c2313c5ebe8aaf6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u201d Alice remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you can\u2019t help that,\u201d said the Cat: \u201cwe\u2019re all mad here.

It\r\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\r\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\r\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\r\ntimidly, saying to herself \u201cSuppose it should be raving mad after all!\r\nI almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the Hatter instead!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nA Mad Tea-Party\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\r\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\r\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\r\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \u201cVery\r\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u201d thought Alice; \u201conly, as it\u2019s asleep,\r\nI suppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\r\none corner of it: \u201cNo room!

After these came\r\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\r\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\r\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\r\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\r\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\r\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\r\nthe King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\r\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\r\n\r\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\r\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\r\nof such a rule at processions; \u201cand besides, what would be the use of a\r\nprocession,\u201d thought she, \u201cif people had all to lie down upon their\r\nfaces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u201d So she stood still where she was,\r\nand waited.\r\n\r\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\r\nat her, and the Queen said severely \u201cWho is this?\u201d She said it to the\r\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cIdiot!\u201d said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\r\nAlice, she went on, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, child?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\u201d said Alice very politely;\r\nbut she added, to herself, \u201cWhy, they\u2019re only a pack of cards, after\r\nall.

Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\r\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\r\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\r\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\r\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\r\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\r\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\r\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\r\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\r\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\r\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\r\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\r\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\r\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\r\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\r\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\r\n\r\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\r\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\r\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\r\nshouting \u201cOff with his head!\u201d or \u201cOff with her head!\u201d about once in a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\r\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\r\n\u201cand then,\u201d thought she, \u201cwhat would become of me? They\u2019re dreadfully\r\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\u2019s any\r\none left alive!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\r\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\r\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\r\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\r\nto herself \u201cIt\u2019s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\r\nto.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\r\nenough for it to speak with.\r\n\r\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s no use\r\nspeaking to it,\u201d she thought, \u201ctill its ears have come, or at least one\r\nof them.\u201d In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\r\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\r\nshe had someone to listen to her.

She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\r\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\r\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\r\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\r\n\r\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\r\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\r\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\r\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\r\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\r\n\r\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\r\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t\r\nmatter much,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cas all the arches are gone from this side\r\nof the ground.\u201d So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\r\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\r\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\r\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\r\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\r\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\r\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\r\nwhat they said.\r\n\r\nThe executioner\u2019s argument was, that you couldn\u2019t cut off a head unless\r\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\r\nthing before, and he wasn\u2019t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\r\n\r\nThe King\u2019s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\r\nbeheaded, and that you weren\u2019t to talk nonsense.\r\n\r\nThe Queen\u2019s argument was, that if something wasn\u2019t done about it in\r\nless than no time she\u2019d have everybody executed, all round.

He was an old crab, _he_ was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never went to him,\u201d the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \u201che taught\r\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo he did, so he did,\u201d said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\r\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons?\u201d said Alice, in a hurry\r\nto change the subject.\r\n\r\n\u201cTen hours the first day,\u201d said the Mock Turtle: \u201cnine the next, and so\r\non.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a curious plan!\u201d exclaimed Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reason they\u2019re called lessons,\u201d the Gryphon remarked:\r\n\u201cbecause they lessen from day to day.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\r\nbefore she made her next remark. \u201cThen the eleventh day must have been\r\na holiday?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course it was,\u201d said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?\u201d Alice went on eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough about lessons,\u201d the Gryphon interrupted in a very\r\ndecided tone: \u201ctell her something about the games now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nThe Lobster Quadrille\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\r\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\r\ntwo sobs choked his voice. \u201cSame as if he had a bone in his throat,\u201d\r\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\r\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\r\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may not have lived much under the sea\u2014\u201d (\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d said\r\nAlice)\u2014\u201cand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster\u2014\u201d\r\n(Alice began to say \u201cI once tasted\u2014\u201d but checked herself hastily, and\r\nsaid \u201cNo, never\u201d) \u201c\u2014so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\r\nLobster Quadrille is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhat sort of a dance is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said the Gryphon, \u201cyou first form into a line along the\r\nsea-shore\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo lines!\u201d cried the Mock Turtle. \u201cSeals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\r\nthen, when you\u2019ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_That_ generally takes some time,\u201d interrupted the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014you advance twice\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEach with a lobster as a partner!\u201d cried the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Mock Turtle said: \u201cadvance twice, set to partners\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014change lobsters, and retire in same order,\u201d continued the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, you know,\u201d the Mock Turtle went on, \u201cyou throw the\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe lobsters!\u201d shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 111445, "end_char_idx": 115182, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14e0ff55-033c-4e36-96a1-ac9b9acd1b10": {"__data__": {"id_": "14e0ff55-033c-4e36-96a1-ac9b9acd1b10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "681b3ce9-f589-43c7-815d-b026178ab5e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "hash": "b3b90e6e03697f74cbe8b553cf71e90ee153d5c3bdcc5912167e36d17a349b6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "44b682c8-3351-45b8-a9d8-0055c38514f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}, "hash": "629f188e1dcd6abb89f06865224502bdac5cbf48fc794e7f2d872cb7c3cbac4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9f9b2aa-2619-4bfc-9eb1-c2207e8c17c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f225c8da408e43540415acab27c6236375d24e0fdcb4ecd95a5de3c719d4976", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u201cThen, you know,\u201d the Mock Turtle went on, \u201cyou throw the\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe lobsters!\u201d shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014as far out to sea as you can\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSwim after them!\u201d screamed the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\u201cTurn a somersault in the sea!\u201d cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\u201cChange lobsters again!\u201d yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cBack to land again, and that\u2019s all the first figure,\u201d said the Mock\r\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\r\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\r\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be a very pretty dance,\u201d said Alice timidly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you like to see a little of it?\u201d said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much indeed,\u201d said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, let\u2019s try the first figure!\u201d said the Mock Turtle to the\r\nGryphon. \u201cWe can do without lobsters, you know.

and how she would\r\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\r\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\r\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\r\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\r\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\r\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN\r\nWONDERLAND ***", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 144955, "end_char_idx": 148139, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"681b3ce9-f589-43c7-815d-b026178ab5e3": {"node_ids": ["f06cd09e-2e7f-4af7-b7d6-59e3ef82edb0", "e402cb89-4de3-4866-b4a5-ef34108b80a5", "c851ffc6-791d-4a9f-be99-f436ce2c32ac", "fb39d827-e6c2-48e9-a09f-8107e72cdc3a", "42d2b7e9-afd0-4ff6-be23-05d47fa24fbe", "659a3fa1-90b2-4240-b61e-70685a3e6d4c", "dfdcc0c7-a4fe-43c8-8dc5-6515e68d1e02", "1c372901-d9a2-4764-a2e9-6142c4031e65", "37667265-f19f-47ad-8605-17eb94e0f8fd", "6a17e554-5b92-4604-9391-9cda2f50cdb2", "22f94eb2-b5e8-4b0c-915e-4c61a6782d27", "72768f43-ede7-4259-ad36-5068a92aeca9", "511e4a7e-ff74-4598-a765-82edec8c6dff", "e328d03c-bc14-4601-8f83-4d9344c09bab", "b68b31d1-dbe7-4c24-ac97-bcef546c2a5d", "2a8cbfff-98d5-4a95-9a78-bf2b7acb7c5b", "e163ae2f-c803-4839-9ff6-7da4a412903f", "c18cb6bf-e854-4db4-93e0-f34c09a38a3f", "b88c6030-6646-4764-8032-c11ca87f09a0", "cd324c60-b219-4373-ab52-828c0ca874c3", "e3d2f983-04c4-48b8-8635-1eea021a13c0", "060f77f8-a323-4b8d-afcf-61bc79fbf914", "2cdb80ed-b8fb-431f-9750-985e07c5e097", "33bbf8ef-c40b-4d4e-ae60-41d428bbfa32", "23fc8bdf-1e98-4db5-9d17-ad4b4505cb12", "82ccbce0-d301-494b-bf88-458226d3e2ca", "ab904b63-0a41-4e4f-b74f-a0527b254dd3", "7d5f4f0e-a9a8-44b5-9eb7-3f6d92946033", "66439f58-5f75-417e-9ea9-b6b0709f2b3b", "82524323-3318-4ba7-9786-aca58a1b7620", "44b682c8-3351-45b8-a9d8-0055c38514f0", "14e0ff55-033c-4e36-96a1-ac9b9acd1b10", "d9f9b2aa-2619-4bfc-9eb1-c2207e8c17c0", "8ab295f1-4dcb-4149-b52c-94c0130e1fd1", "750908ce-750b-483e-9c3e-d130a13e089e", "02f4188f-0c93-4e1f-850d-ead581184773", "c05bdd9e-73da-4c37-ac97-f1cab2e9132c", "9599ce88-3189-449d-9cba-ed17fa0fadf8", "1f9d7223-ef4e-4815-ac0b-91012ee53ff2", "fa1d6086-1500-4bb5-9a55-915ee9c74a04"], "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/documents/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 154638, "creation_date": "2024-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-28"}}}}
