Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next.

And she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you\ncan\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\nshe\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u201d\n\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\ncarefully, remarking, \u201cI really must be getting home; the night-air\ndoesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u201d and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\nto its children, \u201cCome away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you were all in\nbed!\u201d On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\nalone.\n\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u201d she said to herself in a melancholy\ntone. \u201cNobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\nany more!\u201d And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\ncoming back to finish his story.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 30695, "end_char_idx": 32487, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c977b29-2b5e-4adb-ac39-8cd17e89d6a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c977b29-2b5e-4adb-ac39-8cd17e89d6a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/alice_rag_llm/data/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 151249, "creation_date": "2024-06-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6719012a-2e00-4899-8155-f76f13498640", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/alice_rag_llm/data/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 151249, "creation_date": "2024-06-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-26"}, "hash": "8f4ca157a7b8b4195741c6a5f1f6f75ccc82c826e923bde969c8cec8e0582130", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e10b962-1bf2-4135-9844-a8b37395269b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pmiron/repos/alice-rag-llm/src/alice_rag_llm/data/alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 151249, "creation_date": "2024-06-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-26"}, "hash": "50a3f20f092edad52770e9bd71a819a1be070e905fc63e835822219299924e44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "525f4ace-6468-4482-8704-b40282846811", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ac626d24946cda622506919ff77ea2e768acd8750358da5d4684b721ac30275", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER IV.\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\n\n\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\nit muttering to itself \u201cThe Duchess!

Alice looked all round her at\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\nwas on the top of it.\n\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\nanything else.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\n\n\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n\n\u201cWho are _you?_\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.

For instance,\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\nknow.\u201d He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \u201cBut perhaps he can\u2019t help it,\u201d\nshe said to herself; \u201chis eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\nhead.

the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\nand this was her dream:\u2014\n\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\nlooking up into hers\u2014she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes\u2014and still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\nstrange creatures of her little sister\u2019s dream.\n\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by\u2014the\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool\u2014she\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution\u2014once more the pig-baby\nwas sneezing on the Duchess\u2019s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\naround it\u2014once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\nLizard\u2019s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\nTurtle.\n\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull reality\u2014the grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds\u2014the rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen\u2019s shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy\u2014and the sneeze of the baby, the\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard\u2014while the\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\nTurtle\u2019s heavy sobs.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 142155, "end_char_idx": 144112, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",
